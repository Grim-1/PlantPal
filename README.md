### Project Description
- Our project is an "innovative plantcare automatation device" that can take care of all of your plants needs with minimal intervention.
- Our project uses "Complex" ü•∑ sensors to track plant health and external factors to take "Smart" decisions.
  

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
- Ever had your plants grow too healthy üí™ ? Ever wished that your pet plant would interact with you like those animal pets ? Did you have too much peace of mind and serenity due to your lush greenery ?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
- Our PlantPal will solve all these problems by giving you plants wheels üí® and a mind of a toddler.
- Our PlantPal will deliver your plants to the mosst ideal dark and cold space so that they do not grow too healthy and get to embrace their moody side.
- Our PlantPal lets your beloved plants communicate with you using cute and personalized emoticons ü•∞.
- The PlantPal helps your plant get more of your time by throwing trantrums, making noises at unconventional hours and zooming around in circles.
