### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
- Ever had your plants grow too healthy ? Ever wished that your pet plant would interact with you like those animal pets ? Did you have too much peace of mind and serenity due to your lush greenery ?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
- Our PlantPal will solve all these problems by giving you plants wheels and a mind of a toddler.
- Our PlantPal will deliver your plants to the mosst ideal dark and cold space so that they do not grow too healthy.
- Our PlantPal lets your beloved plants communicate with you using cute and personalized emoticons.
- The PlantPal helps your plant get more of your time by throwing trantrums, making noises at unconventional hours and zooming around in circles.
